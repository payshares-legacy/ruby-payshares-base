# This is an example of using the higher level "payment" wrapper. Notice
# that we are using KeyPair instead of the raw rbnacl keys and that we need
# not build the entire heirarchy of xdr object manually.
#
# You can see where these helpers are defined in the files underneath /lib,
# which is where we extend the xdrgen generated source files with our higher
# level api.
# 
# NOTE: due to the way that sequence number for a new account are set, this
# example is pretty cumbersome to run.  It is only used for illustrative purposes
# of the flow
